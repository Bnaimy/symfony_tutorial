to create an new page whether html page or a json endpoint

we need two steps :

1 - ) create a route

route is an url for you're page and he point to a controller

2 - ) create a controller

controller is the php function you write that build the page
 you take incoming request info and use it to create a symfony response object which can hold HTML content , json string , or a binary file like image or pdf
